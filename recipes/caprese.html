        <h2>Italian Simplicity</h2>
        
        <p> Just about my favorite thing on earth. Thick slices of tomato and mozzarella, flavored with fresh basil leaves, olive oil, and a beautiful balsamic reduction. Simple, but oh so impressive.</p>
       
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>3 whole ripe tomatoes, thickly cut</li>
            <li>12 oz mozzarella cheese, thickly cut</li>
            <li>fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small saucepan, bring balsamic vinegar to a boil over medium-low heat. Cook for 10 to 20 minutes, or until balsamic has reduced to a thicker glaze. Remove from heat and transfer to a bowl or cruet. Allow to cool.</li>
            <li>When you're ready to serve, arrange tomato and mozzarella slices on a platter. Arrange basil leaves between the slices. Drizzle olive oil over the top of the salad, getting a little bit on each slice. Do the same with the balsamic reduction, making designs if you want. Store extra balsamic reduction in fridge for a later use.</li>
            <li>End with a sprinkling of kosher salt and black pepper. Serve as a lunch, with crusty bread. Or serve alongside a beef main course for dinner.</li>
        </ol>
